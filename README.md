This tiny App runs on localhost and uses MongoDb default port (MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/lensapp).

When an user is not logged in he/she can browse list of my favorite camera lenses. Lenses are divided in three part: Wide angle, Normal and Tele objectives.
After logging in (userid: username, password: pwd) an user can insert and delete lenses from the MongoDb database.

When run in Visual Studio Code:  
1) start terminal and go to directory \LensApp\angular-src. Then run "ng-serve".
2) start a second terminal window and go to directory \LensApp . Then run "node app".

LensApp starts at port 4200 (USAGE: http://localhost:4200/) .
